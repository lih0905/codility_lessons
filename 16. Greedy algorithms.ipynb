    "Greedy programming is a method by which a solution is determined based on making the locally optimal choice at any given moment. In other words, we choose the best decision from the viewpoint of the current stage of the solution.\n",

    "## 16.1. The Coin Changing problem\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given set of denominations, you are asked to find the minimum number of coins with which a given amount of money can be paid. That problem can be approached by a greedy algorithm that always selects the largest denomination not exceeding the remaining amount of money to be paid. As long as the remaining amount is greater than zero, the process is repeated."
